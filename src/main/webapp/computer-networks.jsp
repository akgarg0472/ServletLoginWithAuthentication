            <p>A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital
                interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes. The
                interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network
                technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be
                arranged in a variety of network topologies.</p>

            <p>The nodes of a computer network may include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or other
                specialised or general-purpose hosts. They are identified by hostnames and network addresses. Hostnames
                serve as memorable labels for the nodes, rarely changed after initial assignment. Network addresses
                serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the Internet
                Protocol.</p>

            <p>Computer networks may be classified by many criteria, including the transmission medium used to carry
                signals, bandwidth, communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network size, the
                topology, traffic control mechanism, and organizational intent.</p>
