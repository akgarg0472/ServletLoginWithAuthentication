            <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy
                emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and
                object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
                projects.</p>
            <p>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often
                described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
            <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980's, as a successor to the ABC programming
                language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and
                introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference
                counting and was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a
                major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does
                not run unmodified on Python 3. Older Python still supports Windows 7.</p>
